* reasons for not moving forward
  - 'subversion is good enough' : michael (joe's brother), said when asked the
  question... but he just upgraded from ClearCase to SVN

  you might be like me: want to know (really know) the majority of the tool's
  functionality before switching over full time.  git is a much more complex
  tool, and that's a great excuse for not continuing to sit on it

  case in point for the above: so many wrappers that there are two
  classifications: porcelain and plumbing (only need to use a subset of the
  porcelain to really get moving, though)

  ?

* points to highlight
  a system whose very nature encourages you to change how you develop:
  - branching facility, brief explanation of why (content tracking versus file
  tracking)

  - the index, which allows for local development

  - supposed to ease the pain of merging... find out more about this

  - github: all of the ruby/rails/fun shit is happening there, and at an insane
  pace (pjhyett: "It took RubyForge 1.5 years to serve 500 gems. GitHub did it
  in less than 3 months. Apples to oranges, yes, but a fun fact nevertheless.")

  - crazy power: changes can be undone, modified, history rewritten

  - git-svn does not work with winders... and there goes my fire.

* for full understanding

  - scott chacon's git presentation and slides

  - git internals book (also by chacon) or pragprog's git book (read reviews on
  the latter)
